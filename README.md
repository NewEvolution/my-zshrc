#my-zshrc

Just a copy of my .zshrc for sharing my custom shell functions for NSS.

The zshrc file's contents will need to be added onto the end of your own .zshrc in your user's home directory

In the zshrc file, you must replace the YOUR-GIT-USERNAME-GOES-HERE with your git username.

In the remoterepo file, you must replace the REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-ACCESS-TOKEN with your github access token that you can generate on your github settings page under Personal Access Tokens

The remoterepo file will need to be copied to your /usr/local/sbin and made executable.

You'll need to be using zsh as your shell with the oh-my-zsh addon for this to work.  It uses quite a few custom plugins as well:

1. Bower
1. autojump
1. common-aliases
1. git
1. sublime

More information on these can be found in the challenges section here: https://github.com/nashville-software-school/evening-cohort/tree/master/05-command-line
